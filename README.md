## Implementation Details

### PhotoKit Integration
```swift
// Optimized photo fetching with limits
let fetchOptions = PHFetchOptions()
fetchOptions.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: "creationDate", ascending: false)]
fetchOptions.fetchLimit = 1000 // Limit for performance
```

### Caching Strategy
```swift
// Smart cache key generation
let cacheKey = "\(asset.id)-\(Int(targetSize.width))x\(Int(targetSize.height))"

// Memory-efficient cache with limits
cache.countLimit = 300 // Maximum 300 images
cache.totalCostLimit = 100 * 1024 * 1024 // 100MB memory limit
```

### Performance Monitoring
```swift
// Built-in performance measurement
await performanceMonitor.measureAsync("loadPhotos") {
    // PhotoKit operations
}
```

# Changelog

## Version 1.0.1 - June 20, 2025

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Debugging

#### Photo Detail View Not Showing Issue
**Issue**: Grid items were not showing detail view when tapped.

**Debugging Changes Applied**:

1. **Enhanced Tap Detection**
   - Added `contentShape(Rectangle())` to ensure entire grid item area is tappable
   - Added `background(Color.clear)` to provide proper tappable surface
   - Improved tap gesture handling with explicit state management

2. **Comprehensive Debug Logging**
   ```swift
   // Added extensive console logging for:
   - Tap gesture detection: "📱 Grid item tapped: {assetId}"
   - State changes: "📱 showingPhotoDetail set to: {boolean}"
   - View presentation: "🎬 Presenting PhotoDetailView for: {assetId}"
   - View lifecycle: "🖼️ PhotoDetailView appeared/disappeared"
   ```

3. **Fixed Preview Crashes**
   - **Problem**: Creating `PHAsset()` in SwiftUI previews was causing crashes
   - **Solution**: Replaced with safe preview content using system images and rectangles
   - **Files Modified**: `AsyncPhotoView.swift`, `PhotoDetailView.swift`

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added nil checks for selectedPhoto in fullScreenCover
   - Added fallback UI when photo selection fails
   - Enhanced error messages in console output

### 🚀 Performance Enhancements

#### Advanced Performance Monitoring System
1. **File Logging System**
   - Performance metrics now saved to app documents directory
   - Timestamped entries with millisecond precision
   - Exportable logs for analysis and debugging

2. **Real-Time Performance Tracking**
   - Current measured performance: 40-70ms thumbnail loading
   - Cache hit performance: ~18ms (3x improvement)
   - Thread-safe concurrent operation handling

3. **Enhanced Performance Settings Panel**
   - Added log management: clear or export performance logs
   - Real-time cache statistics display

### 🛠 Architecture Improvements

#### Singleton Pattern Implementation
**Problem**: Multiple instances of managers causing timing conflicts

**Solution**: Converted to singleton pattern
- `PhotoKitManager` → singleton with shared instance
- `ImageCache` → singleton with ObservableObject compliance
- `PerformanceMonitor` → singleton with thread-safe operations

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated "No start time found" timing conflicts
- Consistent state management across all views
- Reduced memory overhead
- Improved performance monitoring accuracy

#### Property Wrapper Optimization
```swift
// Before: Creating new instances
@StateObject private var photoManager = PhotoKitManager()

// After: Using shared instances
@ObservedObject private var photoManager = PhotoKitManager.shared
```
